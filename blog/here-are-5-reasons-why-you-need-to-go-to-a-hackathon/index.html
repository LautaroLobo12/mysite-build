</script> <p>Here&rsquo;s why you need to go to a Hackathon, bullet-pointed:</p> <ul> <li><a href="#h2-1">To Network</a></li> <li><a href="#h2-2">To Learn</a></li> <li><a href="#h2-3">To Build</a></li> <li><a href="#h2-4">To Listen</a></li> <li><a href="#h2-5">To Have Fun</a></li> </ul> <p>But first, let me tell you more about the Hackathon which I attended 2 weeks ago, the Hackatrix. That&rsquo;s when I got inspired to write this post.</p> <p>The Hackatrix was organized by Belatrix, an international software factory recently bought by an even more international software factory: Globant.</p> <p>It was lovely, big thanks to the organizers! Cool prices and cool food through the full day.</p> <p>It was my second time attending the Hackatrix, and their 5th edition in Buenos Aires.</p> <p>I was on a different team than the year before, which is great because that way you get to know new people! We built a platform to connect volunteers with nonprofit organizations, using the create-react-app boilerplate, adding Bootstrap and Redux, and even an API wrote that day by one of the team members using Kotlin. Fact: that guy was a Backend magician.</p> <p>You can take a look at the code <a href="https://github.com/hackathon-prost/">here.</a></p> <p>We ended up being on the half that passed the technical interview and went to the final exposition. Although we didn&rsquo;t win, I can say that it was an awesome experience, I&rsquo;ll get back to the Hackatrix next year for sure!</p> <p>Well, that&rsquo;s it about the recap, now let&rsquo;s see why YOU should go to a Hackathon too!</p> <h2 id=h2-1>To Network</h2> <p>On Hackathons you get to know people. You get to know a possible future employee, employer, someone with you may end up working with&hellip; or even someone that will become a friend! </p> <p>Yes, it may happen too, that you never see them again. But listen, the feeling of sharing the experience with them will never leave you. </p> <p>You will share thoughts, experiences. Why not, right?</p> <h2 id=h2-2> To Learn </h2> <p>Guess what, your team members will teach you things. That always happens. And you will even teach some stuff to others too, reinforcing your knowledge about that specific topic.</p> <p>You will gain confidence when sharing your ideas and your project with others. </p> <p>And you will need to ask for help at some time. Don&rsquo;t be shy, do it! You&rsquo;ll learn new stuff.</p> <h2 id=h2-3> To Build </h2> <p>You will end up with a cool project to enlarge your resume. </p> <p>If you really like the project, you can keep working on the project before the Hackathon ends. You may even end up with a functional app uploaded on the Google Play Store, or something like that. If you give it steroids (not real steroids&hellip; you know what I mean), you will end up with those popping-everywhere things&hellip; a Startup!</p> <h2 id=h2-4> To Listen </h2> <p>At any Hackathon, you&rsquo;ll hear about some cool and brand-new projects and ideas. Your teammates will talk to you about career-path, jobs and experiences, all invaluable pieces of information. </p> <p>Don&rsquo;t stay quiet, but neither talk all day or you are going to lose many insights that will refresh your soul, get you motivated, and lead you in a good way. </p> <h2 id=h2-5> To Have Fun </h2> <p>Finally, the most important thing: have fun! That&rsquo;s what life is all about, right?</p> <p>Smile. Laugh a bit. You may don&rsquo;t get the cool merchandise, either a small price, but you end up fresh, new, motivated, with a cool project to showcase. You get out as a different person, more mature, or more capable to work on your next project.</p> <hr> <p>Now, find a Hackathon near you and go! </p> <p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/just-do-it-shia-UqZ4imFIoljlr5O2sM"><div style="width:80%;height:0;padding-bottom:75%;position:relative;margin-left:10%;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/UqZ4imFIoljlr5O2sM" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder=0 class=giphy-embed allowFullScreen></iframe></div></a></p> <p>You&rsquo;ll have a blast. </p> <p>Comment below if you have participated in a Hackathon, to inspire others to go! </p> </section> </article> <footer id=post-meta> <script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/latest.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML' async></script> <a href="/"> <img class=avatar src="/images/100px-3211424c.jpg" alt=Avatar> <div class=details> <div class=dark>Lautaro Jordan Lobo Ravarotto</div> <div class=light>Web Developer | Computer Science Student</div> </div> </a> <div class=sharing> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Here Are 5 Reasons Why You Need to Go to a Hackathon&url=https://lautarolobo.xyz/blog/here-are-5-reasons-why-you-need-to-go-to-a-hackathon/" target=_blank> <span class=icon-twitter></span> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://lautarolobo.xyz/blog/here-are-5-reasons-why-you-need-to-go-to-a-hackathon/" target=_blank> <span class=icon-facebook></span> </a> <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://lautarolobo.xyz/blog/here-are-5-reasons-why-you-need-to-go-to-a-hackathon/&title=Here Are 5 Reasons Why You Need to Go to a Hackathon&source=https://lautarolobo.xyz" target=_blank> <span class=icon-linkedin></span> </a> </div> <div class=newsletter-wrapper> <div class=ml-form-embed data-account="1607694:c8w6g9c9z6" data-form="1426892:g8s3m6"> </div> </div> </footer> <div id=disqus_thread></div> <script>
